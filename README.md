# .dotfiles
Config files for my Arch Linux laptop. See [system info](README.md/system-info).

## Requirements
- bash (probably)
- git (assuming that you are forking or cloning this)
- NVIM v0.10.1 or above but vim is good enough, I tried to make my nvim setup as close to the vanilla vim as possible.
- tmux 3.0 or above (curr version is tmux 3.4).
- alacritty Version 0.13.2 or above, but any terminal that supports 256 colors is fine, unless you want the color theme.
- sway version 1.9 or above, but it is basically i3 but for wayland, apparently it does not work with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers(?).
- I don't use Desktop Enviornments so I don't know how sway will work with one.

## System Info
- OS: Arch Linux x86\_64 & Windows 11 Dual Boot (but I use Linux on my laptop exclusively now)
- CPU: Intel i7-8565U (8) @ 4.6GHz
- GPU1: Intel WhiskeyLake-U GT2 (UHD Graphics 620)
- GPU2: NVIDIA GeForce MX150
- RAM: 8GB or something.
