# .dotfiles
Config files for my Arch Linux laptop. See [system info](#system-info).

## Requirements
- **bash** (probably)
- **git** (assuming that you are forking or cloning this)
- **NVIM v0.10.1** or above (anything above v0.5.0 should be ok), but vim is good enough, I tried to make my nvim setup as close to the vanilla vim as possible.
- **tmux 3.4** or above (probably compatible with lower versions as well).
- alacritty Version 0.13.2 or above, but any terminal that supports 256 colors is fine, unless you want the color theme.
- **sway version 1.9** or above, but it is basically i3 but for wayland, apparently it does not work with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers(?).
- I don't use Desktop Enviornments so I don't know how sway will work with one.
- Additionally for nvim you *might* need **python, node, and rust/rustc** mainly for LSPs (although the visibility are generally toggled off when I use them).

## System Info
- OS: Arch Linux x86\_64 & Windows 11 Dual Boot (but I use Linux on my laptop exclusively now)

- GPU1: Intel WhiskeyLake-U GT2 (UHD Graphics 620)
